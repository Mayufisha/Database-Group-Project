B. Changes from 3NF to BCNF:

1. **Addressing Multi-Valued Dependencies**:
   - Created separate junction tables for many-to-many relationships:
     - Driver_Emergency_Contact
     - Driver_Address
     - Driver_Qualification
     - Service_Provider_Address
     - Location_Address
     - Customer_Address

2. **Removing Functional Dependencies on Non-Keys**:
   - Modified Vehicle table to reference Vehicle_Type_ID instead of storing Make_Model and Fuel_Type directly
   - Ensured all determinant attributes are candidate keys

3. **Normalizing Composite Attributes**:
   - Restructured relationships between entities and their addresses using junction tables
   - Separated location data from address data {conceptually different}

4. **Ensuring All Determinants are Candidate Keys**:
   - Reviewed all tables to ensure every determinant {attribute that determines other attributes} is a candidate key
   - Created junction tables where needed to enforce this rule

These changes ensure that for every non-trivial functional dependency X â†’ Y in the database:
- X is a superkey {i.e., X can uniquely determine all attributes in the table}
- This eliminates certain types of anomalies that can occur even in 3NF
