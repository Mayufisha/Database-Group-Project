Final Project Guidelines for Database Course

1 Project Overview

The final project for this course involves developing a database application that demonstrates your understanding of database concepts, including database design, normalization, and user interface
implementation. You are expected to design and implement a complete database solution for a real-world problem. This project should include both a well-designed database and a user-friendly
interface.

2 Project Requirements
The project must meet the following key criteria:

        1. Complexity of the Idea and Applicability:
        • The project should involve a database that is complex enough to demonstrate your
        understanding of the course concepts, including normalization and data modeling.
        • The application should address a real-world problem or provide a useful solution.
        • The project should be applicable in a practical scenario, such as inventory management,
        student record systems, hospital management, or any other system where data storage
        and retrieval are critical.
        
        2. Good Database Design:
        • The database should be designed using normalization techniques (at least up to 3NF,
        preferably BCNF). This ensures minimal redundancy and dependency.
        • The database design should be documented, including tables, relationships, primary and
        foreign keys, and any other constraints.
        • You should include a well-designed Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that clearly represents the structure of your database.
        
        3. Good User Interface:
        • The user interface (UI) should be intuitive and easy to use. It should allow users to
        interact with the database and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
        • The UI can be implemented using Tkinter (as discussed in class) or any other web-based
        framework (e.g., Flask, Django, or React).
        • The UI should present the data in a user-friendly manner (e.g., tables, forms, etc.), and
        provide feedback to the user (e.g., success or error messages).
      
        4. Implementation:
        • You must implement the database using an SQL-based system (e.g., MySQL).
        • The application must be able to interact with the database through the UI, performing
        database operations as requested by the user.
        • Your application should seamlessly perform adding, deleting, updating, querying, and
        analyzing data in your database (for example give a summary of the data in the database).
        • Your implementation should handle edge cases (e.g., input validation, handling errors).
        
        5. Additional Features (Optional but Recommended):
        • Authentication and Authorization: Implement user login and roles (e.g., admin, regular
        user).
        • Reporting: Include a reporting feature where the user can generate reports (e.g., sales
        report, student grades report, etc.).
        • Data Export/Import: Provide the option to export data to formats such as CSV or Excel,
        or import data from these formats.
        • Search Functionality: Implement advanced search functionality that allows the user to
        search the database based on multiple criteria.
        
        6. Documentation:
        • Provide a comprehensive report detailing your database schema, design decisions, and
        any additional features you implemented.
        • The report should also include:
        – Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram.
        – SQL code for creating the database schema (tables, relationships).
        
3 Assessment Criteria
Your final project will be assessed based on the following criteria:

      1. Complexity and Applicability of the Idea: The problem should be realistic and appropriately challenging for a database project.
      2. Database Design: Quality of the database schema, including normalization and relationships. Proper use of primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints.
      3. User Interface: The user interface should be functional, user-friendly, and visually appealing. The interface should facilitate interaction with the database and handle basic operations.
      4. Implementation: Proper functionality and efficient database queries. Handling edge cases,error handling, and testing.
      5. Documentation: Clear and comprehensive documentation of the project, including the database schema, ER diagram, SQL code.

4 Submission Requirements
The final project should include the following:

        1. GitHub Repository: Your project must be uploaded to a GitHub repository. The rrepository should contain all the source code, SQL files, documentation, and any other relevant files.
        Ensure that the repository is well-organized, and commit messages are clear and descriptive.
        2. You should submit the link for the repository to Moodle.
        3. One page of project explanation like what the project is about and its features.
        4. One page ER or EER diagram for the project.

5 Team Formation

        1. Team Size: Teams of up to 4 students are allowed to work together on the project.        
        2. Roles and Responsibilities: It is recommended that each team member take on specific roles (e.g., database design, UI development, testing, documentation) to divide the work
        efficiently.
        3. Collaboration: Ensure that all team members contribute equally to the project. Any team member who is not contributing to the project may affect the team’s final grade.

6 Presentation

        1. The project should be presented in around 15-20 minutes over Zoom in an online session after the final exam.
